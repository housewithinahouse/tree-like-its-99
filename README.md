99
==
a script for generation of directory tree on a website, styled like it's 99. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These not much to the script, call it with "<pre>make_dir_tree( $glob_query )</pre>, where <pre>$glob_query</pre> is a glob query for the root of the tree. It moves through the file system and makes a nested set of lists out of it. 

Otherwise, theres a bit of styling to get the hover to expand and little else.
